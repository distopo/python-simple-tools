## This Repo ##

This repo is the start of a collection of simple tools I intend to develop just for fun and improving my Python skills.

First one is:

- video2image, a photo fram extractor I used to extract multiple sample photos from a video to optimise my workflow of image labeling I needed for a model I trained.
